# Integrating-Airflow-with-Snowflake
 Automate data workflows seamlessly by integrating Apache Airflow with Snowflake, enabling efficient orchestration and management of data pipelines in the Snowflake data warehouse environment. Streamline data processing and enhance collaboration across your analytics infrastructure.

 # Snowflake Automation DAG - Project Overview

This Apache Airflow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) automates Snowflake operations by creating a table and inserting data. Below is a breakdown of the key components and functionalities of the DAG.

## DAG Structure

The DAG, named `snowflake_automation_dag`, consists of two tasks:
1. **create_table:**
   - Task to execute a Snowflake SQL query that creates a table named `source_table` if it doesn't already exist.
   - Utilizes the SnowflakeOperator from the `contrib.operators.snowflake_operator` module.

2. **insert_snowflake_data:**
   - Task to execute a Snowflake SQL query that inserts sample data into the `source_table`.
   - Also uses the SnowflakeOperator.

## Snowflake Connection

Both tasks use the same Snowflake connection ID, specified as "snowflake_conn." Ensure that the connection details are correctly configured in Airflow.

## Snowflake SQL Queries

The `snowflake_query` variable holds two SQL queries:
1. The first query creates the `source_table` if it doesn't exist, defining its columns.
2. The second query inserts sample data into the `source_table`.

## Task Dependencies

The `insert_snowflake_data` task depends on the successful completion of the `create_table` task. This ensures a sequential execution order.

## Execution

The DAG is designed for manual triggering (`schedule_interval=None`). Once triggered, it creates the table and inserts data into Snowflake.

## Configuration

Make sure to configure the Snowflake connection in Airflow with the correct credentials and connection details.

## Logging

Logging is configured at the INFO level. Check the Airflow logs for detailed information on DAG execution.
